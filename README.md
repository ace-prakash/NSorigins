# 1⃣ \[1934] Baade and Zwicky: Super-novae and neutron stars

W Baade, F Zwicky, [On super-novae](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.20.5.254). Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 20, 254–259 (1934).

A) Common novae

"... two well-defined types of new stars or novae which might be distinguished as _common novae_ and _super-novae_." (<mark style="color:yellow;">References needed:</mark> Summarizing the observational properties and typical plots.)

"Common novae seem to be a rather frequent phenomenon in certain stellar systems. Thus, according to Bailey, ten to twenty novae flash up every year in our own Milky Way. A similar frequency (30 per year) has been found by Hubble in the well-known Andromeda nebula."  (<mark style="color:yellow;">Look up:</mark> Reference 1 Bailey from paper; <mark style="color:yellow;">References needed:</mark> Hubble's novae in Andromeda.)

Common novae have absolute brightness at maximum, with a mean of -5.8 and a range of 3-4 mags. (<mark style="color:yellow;">References needed:</mark> Plot or table of maximum magnitude of novae). The maximum corresponds to 20,000 times the radiation of the Sun.

Consistent with these novae being found in systems at distances where -5 absolute magnitude stars have been found (<mark style="color:yellow;">Clarification:</mark> How are distances measured in such systems? Variable stars?)

B) Super-Novae

The second class of novae was puzzling because they were found not only in nearer systems but all over the accessible range of nebular distances.  (<mark style="color:yellow;">References needed:</mark> A plot, table, or reference would be useful)

At maximum brightness, they emit light nearly as much as the whole nebula in which they originate. Presumably, arguments are based on just apparent magnitude measurements and comparisons between novae and their host galaxies. (<mark style="color:yellow;">References needed</mark>) Hubble's extragalactic systems have absolute total luminosities of mean Mv = -14.7 with small scatter (<mark style="color:yellow;">References needed</mark>), individual novae maximum brightness of the order of Mv = -13.

A typical specimen appeared at the center of the Andromeda nebula in 1885, reaching a maximum apparent brightness of m = 7.5 (<mark style="color:yellow;">References needed</mark>). Since the distance modulus of the Andromeda nebula is m - M = 22.2,  the absolute brightness of the nova at the maximum was M = -14.7.

Integration of the light curve shows that practically the whole visible radiation is emitted in the 25 days of maximum brightness, which is equivalent to the light emitted by the Sun in 10 million years at the current strength.

"About the final state of the super-novae, practically nothing is known." Bright nova of 1885 in Andromeda has faded below absolute magnitude -2.\
Only meager facts are known of initial states: (i) super-novae occur in blurred central parts of nebulae as well as spiral arms where individual stars are resolvable (ii) Tycho Brahe's super-nova of 1572 in its initial stage was not brighter than apparent magnitude 5 since it does not register in catalogs (<mark style="color:yellow;">Clarification needed on completeness of catalogs from 1572</mark>).

The frequency of super-novae seems much lower than that of common novae. Frequency of Super-novae of the order of 1 per nebula per several centuries. (Nebular observations were relatively recent, and the only suspected Super-nova in our galaxy was believed to be in 1572)

Assumptions based on available observations:

(i) Super-novae represent a general phenomenon and appeared in all stellar systems at all times as far back as a billion years. Conservative occurrence rate of one super-nova per thousand years.

(ii) Super-novae, initially, are quite ordinary stars whose masses are not greater than $$10^{33} - 10^{35}$$ g. (<mark style="color:yellow;">References needed:</mark> What was the range of stellar masses known then?)

(iii) Supernova of 1885 in Andromeda is a fair sample. Basing the following calculations on that Super=nova:\
(a) At maximum, luminosity equals $$6.3\times10^7 L_\odot$$, and total energy output represents $$10^7$$years of $$L_\odot$$, that is $$E_v = 1.19\times10^{48}$$ ergs.\
(b) A common nova reaches maximum brightness in about 2-3 days. Indications are that a super-nova reaches maximum brightness during about the same interval.
